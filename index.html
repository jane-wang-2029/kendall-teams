    <section id="not-bootcamp">
      <h2>kTeams is not a Boot Camp</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike traditional boot camps, kTeams focuses on high-touch, personalized market exploration rather than 
        standardized curriculum. The program is designed as a "contact sport" where teams engage directly with 
        the ecosystem, building real relationships and gaining practical insights tailored to their specific 
        market entry challenges.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curriculum emphasizes hands-on experience, strategic introductions, and personalized mentorship 
        rather than classroom-based instruction. Each team receives customized guidance based on their industry, 
        stage, and market goals.

    <section id="history">
      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        kTeams has its roots in the eTeams@MIT program, which was hosted by MIT since 2011. The eTeams@MIT 
        program established a proven model for helping international teams understand and engage with the 
        US market through hands-on experience in the Boston innovation ecosystem.
      </p>
      <p>
        kTeams spun off from eTeams@MIT with the same core team, many of the same speakers and mentors, 
        and the same high-touch "contact-sport" approach to curriculum delivery. The program maintains 
        the strong connections to MIT and the Greater Boston ecosystem that made eTeams@MIT successful, 
        while offering flexibility and focus on Kendall Square as a hub for innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        The program leverages the same deep understanding of US startup culture, investor expectations, 
        and market dynamics that were developed over years of running eTeams@MIT, ensuring participants 
        receive proven, effective guidance in their market exploration journey.
